// callback
// Function to execute on each element in the array, taking four arguments:

// accumulator
// The accumulator accumulates the callback's return values; it is the accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or initialValue, if supplied

// currentValue

// The current element being processed in the array.

// currentIndex *Optional*
// The index of the current element being processed in the array.
//  Starts at index 0, if an initialValue is provided, and at index 1 otherwise.

// array *Optional*
// The array reduce() was called upon


// VIA FREE CODE CAMP
// Finding an Average with the Reduce Method In JavaScriptâ€‹
// Instead of logging the sum, you could divide the sum by the length of the array before you return a final value.

// The way to do this is by taking advantage of the other arguments in the reduce method.
// The first of those arguments is the index. Much like a for-loop, the index refers
// to the number of times the reducer has looped over the array. The last argument is the array itself.

    return total/array.length;
