//A prime number is a number that is only is divisble by 1 and itself

// 7 is 1 and itself 6 , would be 2 & 3.
// find the first 100 prime numbers
// no input but outputs an array of 100 prime numbers.
// Array Length would be 100.

//loop until we have hit the length of 100


const primeNumber = (input) => {
    let primeArray = []

    while (primeArray.length < 100) {

        primeArray.push(result)
    }
console.log(primeArray)
}

primeNumber(1)



/*
1. while array.length ===  less than 100 I++
2. take the initial number
3. continue and as soon as you get to the end
and it is not divisible you put it in the prime # array.
4. counter = 2 and if the i % counter = 0 we add to the counter and therefore check the next#
(we stop the loop when the array hits half the size of the divisor)
5.ONCE YOU DETERMINE IT IS NOT A PRIME NUMBER you throw it out
/*
}

google 50 prime numbers returns an array and check it vs googs result  s

let divisor = 2
//if possible prime % number = 0 it is not a prime number , if it is not divisible by 2
// counter if mod =

1,2,3,

prime = []

check to see if thing is an a palindrome
